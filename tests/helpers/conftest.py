"""
Shared fixtures for helpers module tests.

This module provides pytest fixtures for helper module testing. Note that
the helper tests now use concrete test implementations instead of external
fixture files to simplify test setup and avoid complex multiple inheritance.
"""

# Note: Previously this file contained fixtures for external test data files,
# but the tests have been refactored to use concrete test implementations
# directly in the test modules for better maintainability.
